        <p>I happen to be a Southern born and raised author who took the long way around to get there. Born in Texas, raised in the cloud of the oilfield, and then moved to Tennessee to pursue success in textiles and hosiery mills. This rearing in heavy industry, the sort that turns boys into men, shaped my perspectives on what is work, what is play, and oddly enough, what makes a good story.</p>
        <p>A lifelong reader, long aspiring writer, a pen and paper gamer, an amateur baker, horse owner, and enthusiast of things that are weird and wonderful, I take these things and use them to craft weird tales, dark romance, and whatever else crossed my improvised desk and workspace.</p>
        <p>I live in an insular small East TN town with my wife of 18 years.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Time Travel - Love - Action & Adventure - this book has it all. This book was an amazing read. The authors came together and the two worlds just meld together. I loved Eaman and Avery's story and I don't believe I have read another book quite like this one. If you love tales of pirates and searching for ship wreckages and treasures, mixed in with a love story and twists you won't see coming, this book is for you.!&rdquo;</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Wow! I have read some of Timber Philips' books, but hadn't read her co-author. Can I just say that it was so freaking good. I wasn't sure what to expect, and when I started it was a little confused, since Timber usually writes contemporary scenes. But then I got into it and could not stop reading. I'd start a chapter and think I'd only read one, only to have to keep on going. The twists and turns it took were masterful, and I just absolutely loved it.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Great story!!! Poor Sadie has had a hard time of life and is saved by the most unsuspecting men. Love the dynamic of the characters, their actions and the plot twists. 2 men with a separate past have come together and have their own relationship and story with Sadie and come together. Highly suspenseful and does end in a cliffhanger. Normally I don’t care for them but this author never disappoint and can not wait for the next!&rdquo;</p>
